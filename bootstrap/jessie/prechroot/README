Define your target ressources for the installation: hard disk, usb device,
RAID, DRBD, crypto container as LUKS, LVM etc. and create the filesystems
and swap space. Then mount the future rootfs to /mnt (you may change this
only if you know what you're doing), create other mountpoints (mkdir) and
mount all later needed/wanted filesystems where they belong.

Done that you're ready to debootstrap the system. In addition to that, the
script bootstrap/jessie/prechroot/sbin/debotstrap.sh copies some useful files 
as .bash_history (initialization), .bashrc and vim configuration into root
user settings. This is useful for a better workflow when you're inside the
chroot environment.
