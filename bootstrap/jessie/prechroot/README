Define your target ressources for the installation: hard disk, usb device,
RAID, DRBD, crypto container as LUKS, LVM etc. and create the filesystems
and swap space. Then mount the future rootfs to /mnt (you may change this
only if you know what you're doing), create other mountpoints (mkdir) and
mount all later needed/wanted filesystems where they belong.

Done that you're ready to debootstrap the system. In addition to that, the
script

     bootstrap/jessie/prechroot/sbin/debootstrap.sh

copies some useful files as .bash_history (initialization), .bashrc and the
vim configuration into root's users' settings.  This is useful for a better
workflow when you're inside the chroot environment.

As an simpler version of this idea, the script

     bootstrap/jessie/prechroot/sbin/prechroot-copy.sh 

copies the files without debootstrap (you can use a debootstrap template
from hard disk which is faster than network debootstrap). Be aware that
the bootstrap toolchain is expected to be located in /opt/ and thus the
full prechroot path is:

     /opt/bootstrap/jessie/prechroot/

The copy procedure copies the whole subtree /opt/bootstrap to /mnt/opt/bootstrap
because it is needed to continue in the chroot environment. It can be used later
to install a third system from the second and so forth.
