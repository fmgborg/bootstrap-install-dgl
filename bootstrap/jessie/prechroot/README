Define your target ressources for the installation: hard disk, usb device,
RAID, DRBD, crypto container as LUKS, LVM etc. and create the filesystems
and swap space. Then mount the future rootfs to /mnt (you may change this
only if you know what you're doing), create other mountpoints (mkdir) and
mount all later needed/wanted filesystems where they belong.

Done that you're ready to debootstrap the system. In addition to that, the
script

     bootstrap/jessie/prechroot/sbin/debootstrap.sh

copies some useful files as .bash_history (initialization), .bashrc and the
vim configuration into root's users' settings.  This is useful for a better
workflow when you're inside the chroot environment.

As an early version of this idea, the script

     bootstrap/jessie/prechroot/sbin/pre-chroot-copy-qnd.sh 

copies the files without debootstrap. Be aware that the bootstrap toolchain
is expected to be located in /opt/ and thus the full prechroot path is:

     /mnt/opt/bootstrap/jessie/prechroot/
